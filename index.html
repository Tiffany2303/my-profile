    <h1> Hello, </br>Hello, I'm Tiffany Appriou!</h1>
    <img src="images/profile.jpeg" class="img-circle">

    <p>I am currently enrolled in my first year in the Grande Ecole program at IESEG School of Management (English track). Being an international student, I had the opportunity to live abroad during my school years and learn foreign languages such as Chinese. This has made me culturally adaptable and gain a broader perspective. Moreover, I like to analyse data and solve problems.
      <br> I believe that the skills and experience I have gained so far from an international and competitive environment define me.

  <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
  <h3>Sport</h3>
  <p> Apart from academics, I have also recently been appointed as representative of the women's basketball team at my school’s student sports office. I oversee the team and organize sports competitions on a European scale such as “Euroma”. This project gives me the opportunity to experience large-scale project management as well as teamwork. </p>

  <h4>Voyages</h4>
  <p> During a period of expatriation in Israel, I met many people of different nationalities. This period wakened in me a curiosity about the world and developed my skills in cultural awareness and communication. On a schoolwork placement, I had a hands-on experience in the first Decathlon store in Israel. This job sparked my interest in the business world. </p>

  <h2>My business profile</h2>
  <p>To describe myself in a few words; I am sociable, determined, and hardworking. In order to develop a career in banking, I follow classes in statistics and probability. Moreover, I have several experiences in client services; an internship at “Decathlon” Israel where I advised customers in Hebrew and a position at ‘Caroll” as a sales assistant and stock controller. </p>
